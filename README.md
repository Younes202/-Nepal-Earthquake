# Earthquake Damage in Kavrepalanchok

## Overview

Welcome 👋!, In this project, we will analyze and assess the damage caused by earthquakes in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal. Using data collected from [Open Data Nepal](https://opendatanepal.com/), this project employs data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the patterns and impacts of earthquake damage to improve future disaster preparedness and response.

## Project Overview

1. **Get Data by Querying Various Sources** 📊🔍
   - Government reports and databases
   - Satellite imagery
   - Seismological data
   - Crowd-sourced information

2. **Prepare Data for Analysis** 📈🕒
   - Cleaning and formatting data
   - Handling missing values
   - Integrating data from multiple sources

3. **Build and Train Models** 🔨📈
