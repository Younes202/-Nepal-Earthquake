# Prediction of earthquake damage in Kavripalanchuk 🇳🇵

## Overview

Welcome 👋!, In this project, we will analyze and assess the damage caused by earthquakes in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal. Using data collected from [Open Data Nepal](https://opendatanepal.com/), this project employs data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the patterns and impacts of earthquake damage to improve future disaster preparedness and response.

## Project Overview

- **Get data by querying a sqlite database** 📊🔍

- **build a logistic regression model for classification** 🔨📈

- **build a decision tree model for classification** 🌳📈

- **incorporate ethical considerations into our model building** 🤝🧠


## Key Insights

- **Damage Distribution Map**: Visualization of earthquake damage distribution
- **Temporal Analysis**: Patterns of damage over time
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicting damage levels based on historical data
